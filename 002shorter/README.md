# Shorter Dashed Lines
### Write a program that will have Tracy draw a dashed line across the x-axis.
Make sure:
* Tracy starts at the left side of the canvas
* Lines are 50 pixels long
* Space between lines in 50 pixels

:turtle: **Hint:** The entire canvas width is 400 pixels - so to figure out how many times Tracy will need to repeat these commands, divide the width by how far Tracy has moved to draw the first dash and space!
