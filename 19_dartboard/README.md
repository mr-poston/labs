# Dartboard
### Write a program that draws a dartboard.
Make sure your dartboard:
* Consists of 4 concentric circles
* Has the center circle placed in the middle of the canvas with a radius of 25
* Has three circles surrounding the middle, that each increase in radius by 25 pixels

Be sure to also:
* Use a variable called `radius` to control the radius of the circles
* Use a function in your program

🐢 **Hints:**
* Determine how to draw one circle that is centered on the canvas and then add the other circles using the same function.
* The circle radii are getting 25 pixels larger each time, so find a way to move Tracy to the correct position before drawing each circle so they are centered!
