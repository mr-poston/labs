## Course Description

This course uses Snap!, a blocked-based programming environment, and transitions to Python, a text-based programming language.  
Computing has changed the world in profound ways: it has opened wonderful new ways for people to connect, design, research, play, create, and express themselves. However, using the computer is just a small part. This course is an introductory programming course that helps prepare students for more advanced programming courses. We will use Snap!, an approachable, visual, block-based programming language, with a robust tool set, perfect for introducing students to code for the first time. Snap! is taught during the first semester of the full year course. In second semester, students will benefit from exposure to a Python-based programming curriculum.

### Prerequisites

This course is designed for students with algebra readiness skills. No prior programming experience is required.

### Class Supplies

* Pen or pencil
* Paper
* A good attitude

### Class Expectations

* Arrive to class on time
* Be prepared to learn
* Work hard and learn from your mistakes
* Follow the posted classroom expectations
