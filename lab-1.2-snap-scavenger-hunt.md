# Lab 1.2 - Snap! Scavenger Hunt

In this lab, you will explore the functionality of some common blocks and where they are in the palette.

## Part 1: Locating common blocks

1.1\) Fill in the name of the category to which each block belongs in the chart in your Lab Notebook. The first one is already filled in for example.

## Part 2: What does it do

2.1\) Describe the function of each block in the chart in the chart in your Lab Notebook. If the block accepts arguments \(contains values that you can change\), be sure to test out a few different ones to make sure you fully understand what those values mean. The first one is already filled in for example.

| Block | Function |
| :--- | :--- |
| [![point in direction](https://github.com/TEALSK12/introduction-to-computer-science/raw/master/images/point_in_direction.png)](https://github.com/TEALSK12/introduction-to-computer-science/blob/master/images/point_in_direction.png) | _Changes the direction that the sprite is facing. The argument indicates the number of degrees the sprite turns clockwise from pointing upwards. When the argument is "90", the sprite points right, and so on._ |

2.2\) At this point, you may be noticing some patterns. Use what you've learned from exploring these blocks to answer the questions in the chart in your Lab Notebook about each block category.

* What do the blocks in the **Motion** category do?
* What do the blocks in the **Looks** category do?
* What do the blocks in the **Sound** category do?
* What do the blocks in the **Pen** category do?

## Part 3: Put it all together

You are now going to use some of the blocks you've explored to create, save, and submit a Snap! program.

1. Create a script that plays 4 different notes with at least 2 rests in between.
2. Use the repeat block to play your song on loop.
3. Create a script that initializes the sprite at position \(-20, 10\). Then, have the sprite draw a shape that has at least 2 different colors and 2 different line thicknesses. An example would be a square that has 2 thin red sides, and 2 thick blue sides.
