# Lab 7.3 - Printing Variables

### Part 1 - Printing Practice

Practice typing out some statements in the editor part of the IDE, then hit "Run" at the top of the screen. Record the output for each line in the Google Form.

| Expression                                                        | Output | Did anything unexpected happen? |
| ----------------------------------------------------------------- | ------ | ------------------------------- |
| `print("1")`                                                      |        |                                 |
| `print(1)`                                                        |        |                                 |
| `print(1 + 2)`                                                    |        |                                 |
| `print("1" + "2")`                                                |        |                                 |
| `print("this" + " " + "is" + " " + "a" + " " + "sentence" + ".")` |        |                                 |
| `print("this" + "is" + "a" + "sentence" + ".")`                   |        |                                 |
| `print("this", "is", "a", "sentence", ".")`                       |        |                                 |

### Part 2 - Variables Practice

#### 1a. In Your Console

\*\* Type and run the following \*\*

```
animal = "dogs"
print(animal + " are really cool.")
```

#### 1b. In the Goolge Form

\*\* Respond to the following questions \*\*

1. What happens?
2. How could you make the program print out "cats are really cool" instead?

#### 2a. In Your Console

\*\* Type and run the following\*\*

```
print(dogs + "are cool.")
```

#### 2b. Continue in the Google Form

\*\* Respond to the following questions \*\*

1. What output does this produce?
2. Why does this happen?

#### 3. In Your Console

\*\* Rewrite the following SNAP program in Python \*\*&#x20;

### Part 3 - Four Fours

#### The Four Fours Challenge

Using four 4's and any operations, try to write equations that have the numbers from 0 to 4 as the answer. You should use Python's arithmetic operations:

* `+` addition
* `-` subtraction or negation
* `*` multiplication
* `/` division
* `( )` parentheses for grouping
* `**` power

You may also use 44 or 4.4, which count as two fours, or .4, which counts as one four. For example, one solution for zero is:

```
print("Zero is ", 44 - 44)
```

Can you find a different solution?

Here are what the results, but not the source code, will look like. (Note: answers may have trailing zeros if floating point arithmetic is used which is fine, i.e. 1 may be displayed as 1.0)

```
Zero is 0
One is 1
Two is 2
Three is 3
Four is 4
```

### Bonus

Print the output below, but only using **one** line of code. Feel free to use online resources.

```
Wow!
This is on a new line!
```

### Bonus 2

Can you find four fours for 5 to 10?
