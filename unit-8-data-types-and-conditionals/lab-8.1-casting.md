# Lab 8.1 - Casting

### In Your Lab Worksheet

#### Predict what the following inputs will result in

Once you have filled in the **Prediction** column, check your answers in interactive mode and write the actual result.

| Input               |
| ------------------- |
| `float('1')`        |
| `str(1 + '2')`      |
| `str('2')`          |
| `int('abc')`        |
| `int(float('1.6'))` |
| `float(int(1.6))`   |
| `str(float(1))`     |

### In Your Editor (main.py)

1. Create a program which will take in an input and print out that input divided by 2.
2. Change one line of that program to return only whole numbers.

## Bonus

Make your program have two modes: an integer mode and a float mode.

* Add another input to ask which mode the user wants to use.
* If the user asks for integer mode, then print out integers as the result of your division. Otherwise print out floating-point values (decimals).
* Feel free to research Python3 documentation about division and if-else statements.
