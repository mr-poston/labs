# Lab 8.2c - Can I or Can't I

### In your editor (main.py)

Complete the following coding challenge:

Create a "Can I ride the roller coaster?" program. It will check to see if the user meets the minimum requirements to ride the roller coaster. Have the user input the information needed.

Requirements to ride the roller coaster:

* Height over 50 inches â€“ loophole allows any height if older than 18
* Each ride costs 4 quarters.
* There is a frequent rider pass, which makes the rides only cost 2 quarters.

Print `True` if the user can ride the roller coaster, and `False` if not.

## Bonus
