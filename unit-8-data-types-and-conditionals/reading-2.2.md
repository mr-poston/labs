## Expressions and statements

An expression is a combination of values, variables, and operators. A value all by itself is considered an expression, and so is a variable, so the following are all legal expressions (assuming that the variable x has been assigned a value):

```
17
x
x + 17
```

A statement is a unit of code that the Python interpreter can execute. We have seen two kinds of statement: print and assignment.

Technically an expression is also a statement, but it is probably simpler to think of them as different things. The important difference is that an expression has a value; a statement does not.

## Boolean expressions

A Boolean expression is an expression that is either true or false. The following examples use the operator `==`, which compares two operands and produces True if they are equal and False otherwise:

```
>>> 5 == 5
True
>>> 5 == 6
False
```

True and False are special values that belong to the type bool; they are not strings:

```
>>> type(True)
<type 'bool'>
>>> type(False)
<type 'bool'>
```

The `==` operator is one of the relational operators; the others are:

```
x != y      # x is not equal to y
x > y       # x is greater than y
x < y       # x is less than y
x >= y      # x is greater than or equal to y
x <= y      # x is less than or equal to y
```

Although these operations are probably familiar to you, the Python symbols are different from the mathematical symbols. A common error is to use a single equal sign (`=`) instead of a double equal sign (`==`). Remember that `=` is an assignment operator and `==` is a relational operator. There is no such thing as `=<` or `=>`.

## Logical operators

There are three logical operators: `and`, `or`, and `not`. The semantics (meaning) of these operators is similar to their meaning in English. For example, `x > 0` and `x < 10` is true only if x is greater than 0 and less than 10.

`n * 2 == 4 or n * 10 == 100` is true if either of the conditions is true, that is, if the number is 2 or 10.

The `or` expression is true whenever one of the operands is true and the `and` expression is false whenever one of the operands is false.

Finally, the not operator negates a Boolean expression, so `not (x > y)` is true if `x > y` is false, that is, if `x` is less than or equal to `y`.

Strictly speaking, the operands of the logical operators should be Boolean expressions, but Python is not very strict. Any nonzero number is interpreted as “true.”

```
>>> 17 and True
True
```

This flexibility can be useful, but there are some subtleties to it that might be confusing. You might want to avoid it (unless you know what you are doing).
